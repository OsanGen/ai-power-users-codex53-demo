- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Completed gameplay bootstrap and content integrity smoke checks: script loads successfully, floor IDs 1..13 valid, wave enemy IDs and timing constraints validated.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Replace per-frame/per-spawn object allocations with reusable object pools and epoch-based collision gating.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Hardened `applyPlayerDamage` by sanitizing non-finite hit source coordinates before knockback and routed debug logs through a shared guard; next action: run an interactive repro (`game.showDebugStats = true`) for blocked-hit reason coverage and invuln/shield/state edge validation.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Re-check floor intro/lesson/death overlay clipping and baseline alignment.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Mapped root PNG assets to directional sprite keys (`front/left/right/back`) and switched image load to `encodeURI(path)` so filenames with spaces/parentheses load reliably.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped script cache-bust token to `v=20260216-1` for all game scripts so live clients fetch updated render/main code instead of stale cached bundles.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Keep narrative copy and gameplay content consistent with latest overlays.
- DEPLOY | completed | Push latest fixset and verify live site refresh from HEAD.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Add Floors 10–15 content entries and ensure floor sequence is 1–15 only.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/narrative.js | completed | Add teachCards floors 10–15 (new concept entries only).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Add late-floor archetype pressure (10–15) with two new ENEMY_DEFS types phased in 12–15.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Validate late-floor 10–15 tuning pass/fail: spawn-score metric is monotonically increasing 10→15 and wave endTime constraints hold.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/deploy | completed | Verified live GH Pages payload: floor IDs 1–13 and teach cards 1–13 synchronized in remote `src/content.js` and `narrative.js`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Headless transition smoke check verified: forced floor 10 path reaches PLAYING via UPGRADE_SELECT→LESSON_SLIDE→FLOOR_INTRO with no state errors.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Restored Floor 14 and Floor 15 definitions in `FLOORS` to recover full 1–15 progression after user-reported level loss.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped script cache token to `v=20260218-1` so clients fetch restored 1–15 floor content immediately.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/user_test | completed | User to validate manual floor 10 start from title/console and collect first-pass tuning notes using checkpoint or direct startRun(10).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implemented world-only background strip-warp distortion (PROMPT 7) in `updateDynamicLayer()` with WORLD clipping, reduced-motion gating, per-floor orientation, and quality/floor trippy-based amplitude caps.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implemented floor identity FX packs (1–15), expanded `hasDynamicFloorVisuals` to 1..15, and added pack-driven floor skin static/dynamic dispatch with explicit late-floor (`10–13`) theme + motion overlays.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Investigated post-floor-9 animation flatline report and upgraded floors `10–13` visuals to keep dynamic identity visible: added explicit `FLOOR_VISUAL_THEME` entries for `10–13` and post-nine static/dynamic overlay layers.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Prompt 9 pressure escalation integration is complete: floor dynamic identities now scale density/motion by composed `easeInOutSine` progress and danger via `getDynamicEscalation`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fix regression in `drawEvolutionDissolve` fallback alpha; replace undefined `progression(progress)` call with escalation-derived `baseAlpha`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement optional high-tier chroma edge split: clipped thin WORLD border band (14px) redraw in support accent with per-pass alpha 0.02, gated by quality == "high" and `toggles.chroma`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement PROMPT 11 reduced-motion verification: auto-disable trails/chroma/grain, cap distortion in reduced motion to ≤1px, enforce reduced-motion background/parallax scale, and keep non-hud overlays motion-safe.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement Prompt 12 performance pass: add debug overlay stats (FX tier, particle count, render cache hits/misses) and eliminate per-frame Set churn in `updateFxState` and `pruneBulletTrails`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fix run summary overlays and floor-clear footer progression logic: proper summary pill text anchor x-positions and `FLOORS.length`-based clear footer gating.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement Prompt 6: add render-only fxParticles effect stream with pooled hit sparks and death dissolve fragments.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added directional player character rendering in `drawPlayer` with lazy per-direction sprite path; if assets are missing, a built-in facing-aware procedural model now renders instead of the legacy cog to keep the model visually updated.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implemented GLFX world post-process in `draw()` after world restore and before HUD overlay, with reduced-motion and fallback-safe behavior.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Hardened GLFX integration: status/error tracking, reduced-motion noise suppression, and GLFX state surfacing in debug overlay.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Reworked `drawPlayer` head into a rotating cog motif with subtle color modulation from visual theme support palette and FX intensity.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | blocked | Browser smoke validation not run in this environment (headless tooling only); next action: run a local interactive browser session to enable `game.showDebugStats`, verify GLFX world pass + cog-head visuals render correctly with no HUD distortion in PLAYING, and validate reduced-motion profile behavior.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Migrated player and enemy sprite loading to bucket-based resolver (`assets/characters/...`) with legacy fallback, runtime cache diagnostics (`getSpriteLoadState`), and procedural fallback preservation.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Updated player-facing resolution to prioritize active shoot input direction (aim vector) over movement velocity and bumped sprite cache-bust token to `v=20260218-1`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added robust shoot-frame name fallback aliases (`shoot_up/down/left/right`) so directional art loads even when filenames are not strictly `shoot_front/back` canonical.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Refined shoot input handling so `lastShootKey` is cleared on full reset and refreshed on directional shoot-key keyup, preventing stale shoot direction after key transitions.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Set default `AIPU.input.lastShootKey` to empty state so shoot direction does not default-initialize when no input is active.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/player/main | blocked | New left/right/down sprite files are not present on disk yet (only current `left.png/right.png/front.png` exist); next action: place the three new PNGs at absolute paths so I can overwrite `left.png`, `right.png`, and `front.png`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters | completed | Created character art bucket structure for player and all ENEMY_DEFS-based enemy types with `.gitkeep` placeholders.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Hardened input/motion utility defaults (`arrowKeyToVector`, `unitVector`, `hexToRgb`) against malformed inputs and neutralized unknown shoot-key fallback; next action: run an interactive repro for default-key state and malformed-direction behavior by forcing `AIPU.input.lastShootKey` to an unmapped value and checking no upward movement/rotation regressions.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Added read-only QA diagnostics namespace (`AIPU.qa`) with module graph and sampled state/collection snapshots for automation-safe introspection.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` JSON serializer for deterministic automation checks (mode/floor/player/collections/debug snapshot).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/main.js | completed | Added deterministic stepping hook `window.advanceTime(ms)` and `window.render_game_to_text()` bridge without altering normal RAF gameplay loop.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/automation | completed | Ran `develop-web-game` Playwright client against local server with deterministic action bursts; captured screenshots + `render_game_to_text` snapshots for briefing, lesson, and live PLAYING states.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/enemies | blocked | Automated run reports expected 404 console errors for missing enemy art buckets (`idle.png/default.png` absent); next action: drop enemy PNGs or add placeholder files per bucket to eliminate load-error noise.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Tightened combat input capture so movement and shooting are canonicalized independently (`KeyWASD` vs `Arrow*`), canonicalized shoot-key releases are used for `lastShootKey`, and raw/non-canonical key writes were removed.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped script cache-bust token to `20260218-8` so local clients fetch the latest input-routing and render bundles immediately.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/dependency_audit | completed | Verified floor/teach-card parity is 1..15 with no missing IDs and validated all 17 wave enemy types map to 17 `ENEMY_DEFS` keys with zero missing/unused references.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/final_build/deploy | blocked | Live GH Pages is still serving old runtime mapping for shoot input (`KeyW/A/S/D` accepted as shoot keys in render input list). Next action: deploy latest commit so `.../src/render.js` and `.../src/systems.js` with `v=20260218-8` are published and then re-verify via curl against remote script lines.
