- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Completed gameplay bootstrap and content integrity smoke checks: script loads successfully, floor IDs 1..13 valid, wave enemy IDs and timing constraints validated.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Replace per-frame/per-spawn object allocations with reusable object pools and epoch-based collision gating.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Re-check floor intro/lesson/death overlay clipping and baseline alignment.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Keep narrative copy and gameplay content consistent with latest overlays.
- DEPLOY | completed | Push latest fixset and verify live site refresh from HEAD.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Add Floors 10–15 content entries and ensure floor sequence is 1–15 only.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/narrative.js | completed | Add teachCards floors 10–15 (new concept entries only).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Add late-floor archetype pressure (10–15) with two new ENEMY_DEFS types phased in 12–15.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Validate late-floor 10–15 tuning pass/fail: spawn-score metric is monotonically increasing 10→15 and wave endTime constraints hold.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/deploy | completed | Verified live GH Pages payload: floor IDs 1–13 and teach cards 1–13 synchronized in remote `src/content.js` and `narrative.js`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Headless transition smoke check verified: forced floor 10 path reaches PLAYING via UPGRADE_SELECT→LESSON_SLIDE→FLOOR_INTRO with no state errors.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/content.js | completed | Reduce progression to 13 floors by removing Floor 14 and Floor 15 entries from `FLOORS`; preserve floor 1–13 data unchanged.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/user_test | completed | User to validate manual floor 10 start from title/console and collect first-pass tuning notes using checkpoint or direct startRun(10).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implemented world-only background strip-warp distortion (PROMPT 7) in `updateDynamicLayer()` with WORLD clipping, reduced-motion gating, per-floor orientation, and quality/floor trippy-based amplitude caps.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implemented floor identity FX packs (1–15), expanded `hasDynamicFloorVisuals` to 1..15, and added pack-driven floor skin static/dynamic dispatch with stub-safe no-op handling for 10–15.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Prompt 9 pressure escalation integration is complete: floor dynamic identities now scale density/motion by composed `easeInOutSine` progress and danger via `getDynamicEscalation`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fix regression in `drawEvolutionDissolve` fallback alpha; replace undefined `progression(progress)` call with escalation-derived `baseAlpha`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement optional high-tier chroma edge split: clipped thin WORLD border band (14px) redraw in support accent with per-pass alpha 0.02, gated by quality == "high" and `toggles.chroma`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement PROMPT 11 reduced-motion verification: auto-disable trails/chroma/grain, cap distortion in reduced motion to ≤1px, enforce reduced-motion background/parallax scale, and keep non-hud overlays motion-safe.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement Prompt 12 performance pass: add debug overlay stats (FX tier, particle count, render cache hits/misses) and eliminate per-frame Set churn in `updateFxState` and `pruneBulletTrails`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | pending | Run browser smoke check for `game.showDebugStats`, confirm overlay text is visible, and verify draw cadence still matches `DYNAMIC_FX_FPS`.
