- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Prompt 9 pressure escalation integration is complete: floor dynamic identities now scale density/motion by composed `easeInOutSine` progress and danger via `getDynamicEscalation`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fix regression in `drawEvolutionDissolve` fallback alpha; replace undefined `progression(progress)` call with escalation-derived `baseAlpha`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement optional high-tier chroma edge split: clipped thin WORLD border band (14px) redraw in support accent with per-pass alpha 0.02, gated by quality == "high" and `toggles.chroma`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement PROMPT 11 reduced-motion verification: auto-disable trails/chroma/grain, cap distortion in reduced motion to ≤1px, enforce reduced-motion background/parallax scale, and keep non-hud overlays motion-safe.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Implement Prompt 12 performance pass: add debug overlay stats (FX tier, particle count, render cache hits/misses) and eliminate per-frame Set churn in `updateFxState` and `pruneBulletTrails`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fix run summary overlays and floor-clear footer progression logic: proper summary pill text anchor x-positions and `FLOORS.length`-based clear footer gating.

- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | blocked | Browser smoke validation not run in this environment (headless tooling only); next action: run a local interactive browser session to enable `game.showDebugStats`, verify GLFX world pass + cog-head visuals render correctly with no HUD distortion in PLAYING, and validate reduced-motion profile behavior.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Migrated player and enemy sprite loading to bucket-based resolver (`assets/characters/...`) with legacy fallback, runtime cache diagnostics (`getSpriteLoadState`), and procedural fallback preservation.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Updated player-facing resolution to prioritize active shoot input direction (aim vector) over movement velocity and bumped sprite cache-bust token to `v=20260218-1`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added robust shoot-frame name fallback aliases (`shoot_up/down/left/right`) so directional art loads even when filenames are not strictly `shoot_front/back` canonical.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fixed sprite-path cache staleness by resetting character cache entries when resolved candidate sets change and gated shoot-mode visuals to `GameState.PLAYING` only; deterministic runtime probes now confirm `WASD` movement-only, `Arrow*` shooting-only, and combined movement+shoot behavior.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/main.js | completed | Fixed deterministic stepping drift by using rounded 60Hz step counts in `window.advanceTime(ms)` so `advanceTime(1000)` yields 60 steps instead of 59.

- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Unified malformed sprite decode handling with candidate retry flow (`advanceToNextCandidateOrMissing`) so invalid loaded frames continue to fallback candidates.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Hardened player sprite width clamp to use normalized safe radius for both clamp bounds, preventing NaN-prone width calculations when raw radius is malformed.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Refined shoot input handling so `lastShootKey` is cleared on full reset and refreshed on directional shoot-key keyup, preventing stale shoot direction after key transitions.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Set default `AIPU.input.lastShootKey` to empty state so shoot direction does not default-initialize when no input is active.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Hardened bootstrap and utility layer against missing/malformed DOM/utility inputs: safe element lookup helpers, canvas/context fallback defaults, finite-guarded RNG/array helpers, and defensive geometry/mouse position checks.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/player/main | completed | Labeled movement/shoot frame set is present; next action: run in-browser verification for `WASD` movement vs arrow shooting artifact-free.

- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Hardened input/motion utility defaults (`arrowKeyToVector`, `unitVector`, `hexToRgb`) against malformed inputs and neutralized unknown shoot-key fallback; next action: run an interactive repro for default-key state and malformed-direction behavior by forcing `AIPU.input.lastShootKey` to an unmapped value and checking no upward movement/rotation regressions.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/core.js | completed | Added read-only QA diagnostics namespace (`AIPU.qa`) with module graph and sampled state/collection snapshots for automation-safe introspection.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` JSON serializer for deterministic automation checks (mode/floor/player/collections/debug snapshot).
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/main.js | completed | Added deterministic stepping hook `window.advanceTime(ms)` and `window.render_game_to_text()` bridge without altering normal RAF gameplay loop.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/automation | completed | Ran `develop-web-game` Playwright client against local server with deterministic action bursts; captured screenshots + `render_game_to_text` snapshots for briefing, lesson, and live PLAYING states.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/enemies | blocked | Automated run reports expected 404 console errors for missing enemy art buckets (`idle.png/default.png` absent); next action: drop enemy PNGs or add placeholder files per bucket to eliminate load-error noise.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Tightened combat input capture so movement and shooting are canonicalized independently (`KeyWASD` vs `Arrow*`), canonicalized shoot-key releases are used for `lastShootKey`, and raw/non-canonical key writes were removed.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Added homing-missile `"dual"` enemy runtime support: steering logic (`homing_missile` behavior), impact-triggered explosion burst, 3-second player shooting lockout (`attackDisableTimer`), and no damage application on impact.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Removed global spawn starvation for dual wave activity: regular enemy spawns still soft-cap at `58`, while `dual` waves continue spawning through their windows up to a dual cap of `72`, so homing missiles remain visible under traffic.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped script cache-bust token to `20260218-8` so local clients fetch the latest input-routing and render bundles immediately.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/dependency_audit | completed | Verified floor/teach-card parity is 1..15 with no missing IDs and validated all 17 wave enemy types map to 17 `ENEMY_DEFS` keys with zero missing/unused references.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Added hardening for malformed simulation/spawn data: `update()` ignores invalid deltaTime and resets accumulator on corruption; dual-burst floor resolution is now parsed safely; spawn loop and enemy factory defensively sanitize malformed wave configs and rate/timing fields before processing.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/final_build/deploy | blocked | Live GH Pages may still serve old script hashes if remote cache not invalidated. Next action: deploy latest commit and verify remote `src/render.js`/`src/systems.js` include current cache token `v=20260221-1`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/final_build/deploy | blocked | User requested deploy from this environment but execution policy forbids git-based publication. Next action: run git push from their workstation with updated files in commit and then validate live page and `?v=20260218-10` cache token on `render.js` and `systems.js`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Hardened floor-gated Space-bomb activation by resolving floor IDs from floor override/current floor/index robustly and by requiring `bombChargesPerFloor > 0` before decrement/spawn.

- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/audio.js | completed | Bumped `MUSIC_CACHE_BUST` and script cache tokens to `v=20260221-4` so browser cache no longer masks latest music/visual/input runtime.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Hardened space-bomb gating to use clamped `game.currentFloorIndex`-derived floor IDs and `isBombUnlocked()` in PLAYING input path, ensuring floor-1 never executes Space bomb.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Suppressed shoot/dual pose mode whenever `player.attackDisableTimer > 0` to prevent locked-out dual-homing visual glitches during burst cooldown.

- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Decoupled shoot/dual/movement pose selection from `player.attackDisableTimer` so visual mode follows active Arrow input during lockout.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/audio.js | completed | Bumped `MUSIC_CACHE_BUST` to `v=20260221-16` for deterministic music track refresh on clients after cache invalidation.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Bumped `CHARACTER_ART_CACHE_BUST` to `v=20260221-16` to force fresh sprite cache reads after player art routing update.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped runtime script cache tokens to `v=20260221-16` for audio/render/systems/main consistency.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Fixed bomb gate floor resolution bug: `resolveFloorIdForBombGate(null)` no longer coerces to floor `0`, so floor-2+ SPACE bomb now triggers correctly while floor 1 remains locked.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Bomb briefing intro gate now aligns to `BOMB_UNLOCK_FLOOR` (floor 2), removing incorrect floor-1 bomb briefing flow.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/audio.js | completed | Hardened same-floor replay behavior by removing stale “in-flight” early-return lock; music now retries reliably on floor transitions and user gesture recovery.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added player sprite cache priming + QA audio state in `render_game_to_text` for deterministic verification of move/shoot/dual art and music runtime state.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fixed player stance-scale mismatch during direction/mode fallback draw path (fallback frames now use their own direction stance constants), reducing intermittent player sprite “pop/stretch” glitches.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added `render_game_to_text` player-sprite diagnostics (`facingDirection`, requested/active mode+direction, holdFrames) for deterministic movement/shoot visual debugging.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Removed avoidable dual/shoot mode visual lag: sprite mode now switches immediately when the target frame set is already renderable, and only uses hold-delay when assets are unresolved.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Added shared mode-fallback label resolver to keep draw/fallback and renderability checks consistent for `move|shoot|dual`.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Dual burst hold tracking now accumulates across shoot-direction changes while any Arrow key remains active, matching “continuous shooting” behavior instead of “same-direction-only” behavior.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped `systems.js` cache token to `v=20260221-23` so clients immediately pick up updated dual-hold tracking logic.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/render.js | completed | Fixed stale player sprite-mode state during invulnerability blink: sprite mode state now advances even on blinked frames, preventing stuck `dual/omni` debug/visual state after shoot release.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped `render.js` cache token to `v=20260221-23` for immediate client refresh of blink-state sprite routing fix.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | Added centralized `clearDirectionalBurstTracking()` and applied it on non-PLAYING sim ticks plus `enterGameOver`/`enterDeathLesson` transitions to prevent stale burst-hold state leakage.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/index.html | completed | Bumped `systems.js` cache token to `v=20260221-24` for immediate client rollout of burst-tracking transition reset hardening.
- /Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/src/systems.js | completed | End-to-end deterministic chain verified on floor 10: PLAYING start -> dual -> omni -> bomb decrement -> GAME_OVER -> TITLE restart -> PLAYING restart, with burst hold reset and audio stop/restart behavior remaining consistent.
