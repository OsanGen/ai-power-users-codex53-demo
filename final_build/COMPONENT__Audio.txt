Audio Component

Purpose:
- Own floor-scoped background music playback and track fallback behavior.
- Keep music handling separate from combat/render/state logic while reusing `AIPU.content` floor song resolution.

Inputs:
- `AIPU.content.getSongPathCandidatesForFloor` for floor->track candidate list resolution.
- Floor lifecycle calls from `AIPU.systems`:
  - `beginCurrentFloor` (start/continue current floor playback)
  - `enterGameOver` (stop)
  - `toTitle` (stop)
  - `VICTORY` transition in `update()` (stop)

Outputs:
- `AIPU.audio` singleton with methods:
  - `playForFloor(floorIdOrLabel)`
  - `stop()`
  - `setMuted(value)`
  - `getState()`

State:
- `currentFloorId`
- `currentSrc` / `activeSrc`
- `isPlaying`
- `isMuted`
- `errorCount`
- `lastError`

Edge Cases:
- Missing/invalid floor id falls through to null/first valid candidate or stop.
- Missing track candidate path falls back through configured candidate list before reporting no playable track.
- Multiple browser `play()`/decode errors are non-fatal and update `lastError`.
- `stop()` clears playback source, resets state, and remains safe to call repeatedly.

Dependencies:
- HTMLAudioElement and browser autoplay policy constraints.
- `AIPU.content` floor naming helpers in `/src/content.js`.

Acceptance checks:
- Entering a floor with available track starts looped background music.
- Entering title/game over/victory stops track.
- Missing tracks do not throw and are handled by candidate fallback/stop behavior.
- `AIPU.audio.getState()` returns active source and status without mutating gameplay.
