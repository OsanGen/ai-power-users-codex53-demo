Character Art Bucket Contract Component

Purpose:
- Define the canonical directory-based asset source of truth for character visuals.
- Enable drop-in replacement of character art by adding/replacing PNGs in fixed folder buckets.
- Keep renderer behavior safe during migration by allowing fallback behavior in render logic when present (handled in renderer implementation phase).

Inputs:
- Files on disk under `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/`.
- Player bucket: `assets/characters/player/main/`.
- Enemy buckets: `assets/characters/enemies/<enemyType>/` for each `ENEMY_DEFS` key.
- Optional fallback files in enemy buckets (`default.png`).

Outputs:
- Canonical sprite paths for player and enemy art once renderer routing is wired.
- Folder-level discoverability for authoring checks (presence-only audit).

State:
- No runtime state is stored in this component.
- Canonical files are persisted directly in the filesystem:
  - Player: `front.png`, `back.png`, `left.png`, `right.png`.
  - Enemy: `idle.png` (primary), `default.png` (optional fallback).
- `.gitkeep` files preserve empty folders in git.

Behavior and Edge Cases:
- Player mapping is 1:1 to directions.
- Enemy mapping is by `enemy.type`.
- Missing file/bucket should not fail runtime if renderer handles resolver + procedural fallback.
- Missing/extra file names are ignored by the contract.
- Directory existence is sufficient during authoring; image load success is handled by renderer.

Dependencies:
- `src/render.js` (future sprite resolver + cache routing layer).
- `src/content.js` (`ENEMY_DEFS` defines valid `enemyType` keys).
- `src/systems.js` (`enemy.type` assignment from `waveCfg.enemyType`).

Acceptance Checks:
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/player/main/` exists and contains `front.png`, `back.png`, `left.png`, `right.png`.
- Enemy directories exist for all 16 types in `ENEMY_DEFS`:
  - `signal_echo`, `rabbit_glimpse`, `notification_swarm`, `name_glitch_shade`, `flank_drone`, `speaker_wraith`, `chair_knight`, `hammer_rabbit`, `loop_ghost`, `decay_mote`, `double`, `apex_rabbit`, `cell_blob`, `reach_shadow`, `evolution_rabbit`, `drift_hound`, `arc_turret`.
- All newly created character directories include `.gitkeep` when no art files are present.
