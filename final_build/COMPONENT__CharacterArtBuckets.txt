Character Art Bucket Contract Component

Purpose:
- Define the canonical directory source of truth for character sprites.
- Enable drop-in character art updates by replacing PNGs in fixed folder buckets.
- Keep rendering safe via resolver fallback so folders can be authored before assets are complete.

Inputs:
- Files on disk under `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/`.
- Player bucket: `assets/characters/player/main/`.
- Enemy buckets: `assets/characters/enemies/<enemyType>/` for each `ENEMY_DEFS` key.

Outputs:
- Canonical sprite paths for player and enemy rendering in `src/render.js`.
- Stable bucket structure for authoring and deployment (`.gitkeep` for empty folders).

State:
- No runtime state is persisted by this component.
- Persisted assets:
  - Player: `front.png`, `back.png`, `left.png`, `right.png`.
  - Enemy: `idle.png` (primary), `default.png` (optional fallback).

Behavior and Edge Cases:
- Player mapping is 1:1 to movement-facing directions.
- Enemy mapping is by `enemy.type`.
- Missing folders/files do not fail runtime because `src/render.js` falls back to procedural rendering when candidate paths cannot resolve.
- Legacy root player sprites are retained as fallback candidates in the resolver during migration.
- Extra file names are ignored.

Dependencies:
- `src/render.js` (character sprite resolver + cache + fallback).
- `src/content.js` (`ENEMY_DEFS` defines valid `enemyType` keys).
- `src/systems.js` (`enemy.type` assignment from wave configs).

Acceptance Checks:
- `/Users/abelsanchez/CODEX/WONDERLAND/assets/characters/player/main/` exists and contains `front.png`, `back.png`, `left.png`, `right.png`.
- Enemy directories exist for all 16 types in `ENEMY_DEFS`:
  - `signal_echo`, `rabbit_glimpse`, `notification_swarm`, `name_glitch_shade`, `flank_drone`,
    `speaker_wraith`, `chair_knight`, `hammer_rabbit`, `loop_ghost`, `decay_mote`, `double`,
    `apex_rabbit`, `cell_blob`, `reach_shadow`, `evolution_rabbit`, `drift_hound`, `arc_turret`.
- Every enemy/player directory includes `.gitkeep` while empty.
