Render Component

Purpose:
- Draw all visuals each frame from `AIPU.state`, including environment, entities, HUD, state overlays, and visual theme layers.
- Apply the arena floor visual themes and transition overlays while keeping gameplay state and rules unchanged.
- Add a compounded water-wrapper visual pass for floors `1..8` that deepens support-color integration and animation intensity as floors progress, with a stronger baseline on floor `1` and stronger low-floor motion amplification.
- Add optional, modularized, render-only FX feedback (camera, bullets, particles, distortion) driven by `fxState` and `FX_CONFIG`.
- Support directional player model swap and automatic enemy art routing:
  - Player sprites resolve by bucket from:
    - `assets/characters/player/main/Front.png` (front primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/back.png` (back primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/left.png` (left primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/right.png` (right primary)
    - movement fallback uses canonical names first, then legacy root filenames during migration.
  - Player shoot sprites resolve by bucket from:
    - `assets/characters/player/main/Down_Shoot.png` (front shoot primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/UP_shoot.png` (back shoot primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/Left_shoot.png` (left shoot primary)
    - `assets/characters/player/main/Right_shoot.png` (right shoot primary)
    - canonical shoot aliases are checked next (`shoot_front.png`, `shoot_back.png`, `shoot_left.png`, `shoot_right.png`), then legacy root fallbacks.
  - Player burst sprites resolve by `AIPU.systems.getDirectionalBurstStatus()`:
    - `dual`/`omni` states force `assets/characters/player/main/DUAL.png` (falls back to `dual.png`).
    - Otherwise movement/shoot frame logic continues as above.
    - Burst gating is render-state-stable to reduce one-frame sprite jitter.
  - Enemy sprites resolve by `enemy.type` to:
    - `assets/characters/enemies/<enemyType>/idle.png`
    - `assets/characters/enemies/<enemyType>/default.png` (optional fallback)
- Sprite URLs are cache-busted with `?v=20260221-23`.
- Shoot/move mode is resolved from active `Arrow*` keys (and `AIPU.input.lastShootKey` fallback); when no shoot key is active, movement keys are used; otherwise player facing holds its last valid direction.
  - Missing or failed sprite loads fallback to built-in directional procedural rendering.
  - Fallback draw sizing now uses the fallback frame’s own direction stance scale (not the originally requested direction), which prevents occasional stretch/pop artifacts when rendering `front` fallback frames for side/back requests.
  - Mode-switch smoothing now behaves dynamically:
    - if target mode/direction has renderable frames (or cached fallback), switch immediately with `holdFrames = 0`;
    - otherwise retain the short hold-delay path while assets resolve.
  - Player sprite mode/facing state now updates even during invulnerability blink frames, preventing stale mode carryover in debug/render state when shooting is released while blink-culled draw is active.
  - Player sprite candidates are now pre-primed once per run reset (`move`, `shoot`, `dual` across four directions) to reduce first-use frame pops when switching movement/shoot modes.

Inputs:
- Render state (`AIPU.state.game`, `AIPU.state.player`, entity collections).
- Constants and helpers from `AIPU.constants` and `AIPU.utils`.
- Narrative content helpers from `AIPU.content` for all overlay labels.
- Optional systems callbacks from `AIPU.systems` for collections and state transitions.

Outputs:
- A single frame on `canvas`.
- Overlay content for title, upgrade cards, bomb briefing, lesson/death lesson, floor intro/clear, and run summary.
- Background and world layers with per-floor visual theme data.
- Machine-readable snapshot output through `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` (consumed by `window.render_game_to_text`).

State/Edges:
- Uses `ctx.textAlign`/`textBaseline` state carefully and resets at block exits.
- Uses `withRectClip` for lesson/death text clipping and `withClipRect` for rounded-panel masking.
- Keeps overlay text readable by top-aligned clipping paths with insets.
- Supports reduced-motion by removing motion terms.
- Adds optional background strip-warp distortion in `updateDynamicLayer()` after base corridor draw.
  - Distortion is world-only (`WORLD` clip), low tier disabled/near-flat.
  - Uses per-floor strip orientation and sinusoidal offsets from `fxState.intensity` + `visualTheme.trippyLevel`.
  - Enforces center fade and quality-based max amplitude bounds.
- Adds `getDynamicEscalation(progress)` to derive composed pressure from normalized floor progress and active threat.
  - Dynamic floor motifs (`drawFloorDynamicIdentityByPack`) receive floor progress and scale density/motion using `easeInOutSine` and `easeOutCubic`.
  - `edgeBlend(...)` applies stronger modulation toward WORLD edges so center stays clearer under escalation.
- Floors `1..8` now route through a dedicated water wrapper state (`resolveWaterWrapperState`) and two draw passes:
  - `drawWaterStaticBase(...)` for low-alpha basin bands and static caustic scaffold.
  - `drawWaterDynamicOverlay(...)` for progressive ripple/caustic motion with floor-depth compounding.
  - Added `drawWaterWashLayer(...)` as a dedicated first-pass water wash using blue/mint radial tint + moving stripe accents so 1..8 always reads strongly “watery” even at low floor depth.
  - `buildRenderGameTextState()` now emits `debug.visualState` payload (floor pack/theme/water metrics) for deterministic verification.
  - Wrapper alpha is hard-capped to maintain OSAN readability and lead-accent dominance.
- Reduced-motion support is centralized:
  - `isFxToggleEnabled` disables `trails`, `chroma`, and `grain` when `AIPU.input.prefersReducedMotion` is true.
  - `applyStripWarpDistortion()` caps distortion at ≤1px and scales distortion frequency.
  - Camera and background motion uses a dedicated reduced-motion background scale to keep shake/zoom and floor parallax in the 60–80% reduction band.
  - Lesson/title/death overlays skip or zero out motion terms when reduced-motion is enabled.
- "No hard-flash" check in visual FX paths:
  - avoid full-intensity abrupt color toggles on reduced-motion states;
  - keep chroma/reduce-motion effects below noticeable flash thresholds by clamping alpha and preserving WORLD clipping.
- Added optional high-tier chroma edge split in `applyChromaEdgeSplit()`.
  - Runs only when `FX_CONFIG.quality === "high"` and `FX_CONFIG.toggles.chroma` is true.
  - Draws a clipped 14px WORLD border band with ±1px edge offsets in one support color at low alpha.
  - Guarded to remain subtle and non-glowy (`edgeAlpha <= 0.02` effective per pass).
- Added `FLOOR_FX_PACKS` visual identity matrix (`1..15`) with lead, distortion mode, motif, parallax, lattice metadata.
- `hasDynamicFloorVisuals()` is now 1..15 and floor skins are now driven by pack selection for static + dynamic layers.
  - Floors `1..9` render enriched layered motifs; floors `10..13` add dedicated late-game overlays for stronger movement. Floors `14..15` remain no-op placeholders.
- Added dedicated late-floor static and dynamic post-nine overlay helpers so `10..13` keep visible motion pressure through edge-driven and escalated animated motifs.
- Maintains one-accent rendering by keeping support colors secondary and low-alpha only.
- No gameplay mechanics are changed in render path.
- `hasDynamicFloorVisuals` now safely accepts numeric or numeric-string floor IDs before enabling dynamic layer effects.
- Added a GLFX wrapper post-process on the world layer using `glfx.js` in `applyGlfxWorldPass()`.
  - Initializes WebGL pipeline via `initGlfxWorldFx()` / `tryCreateGlfxWorldFx()` only in render namespace.
  - Uses a cached `fxCanvas` and `sourceCanvas` to keep GLFX updates in world-space only (WORLD clip).
  - Builds tiered filter chains via `applyGlfxPassForTier()`:
    - low: subtle `bulgePinch`
    - medium: `bulgePinch + swirl`
    - high: adds muted `swirl + noise + vignette`
  - Honors reduced-motion by scaling effect down aggressively and avoiding abrupt color-heavy operations.
  - Catches runtime exceptions and falls back to existing native distortions when GLFX fails.
  - Invoked from `draw()` after world rendering and world-camera restore, before HUD and state overlay draws.
- GLFX status/error state is tracked in-process (`ready`, `applied`, `fallback`, `error`, `disabled`, `idle`), with debug surfacing in `drawDebugStatsLine`.
- Added world-layer-only character head variant in `drawPlayer()`:
  - Head now renders as a rotating cog motif with subtle per-frame color shift using floor support/accent mix.
  - Keeps lead accent dominance and avoids gameplay state changes.

Dependencies:
- `AIPU.content` narrative helper methods for labels.
- `AIPU.systems` collections and state helpers.
- `AIPU.utils` for color/geometry/font helpers.
- `index.html` script tags use cache-bust tokens (`render.js?v=20260222-9`) to force updated render bundle refresh.
- Sprite URLs are additionally cache-busted in `src/render.js` (`CHARACTER_ART_CACHE_BUST = "v=20260222-4"`) to avoid stale image caching across art updates.
  - Player movement resolution is labeled-first: `Front.png/back.png/left.png/right.png` with canonical and legacy root fallback.
  - Player shoot resolution is labeled-first: `Down_Shoot.png/UP_shoot.png/Left_shoot.png/Right_shoot.png` with canonical fallback aliases next.

Acceptance Checks:
- No state transitions altered by rendering.
- Lesson/death overlays remain legible with stable baseline/clipping.
- Floor themes resolve consistently by floor id.
- Prompt 12 Performance + debug
  - `drawDebugStatsLine` shows render-only FX diagnostics when `game.showDebugStats` is active.
  - Diagnostic text reports FX tier (`FX_CONFIG.quality`), particle count, and render cache hit/miss counters.
  - Removed hot-path `Set` allocations by reusing render-local sets in `updateFxState` and `pruneBulletTrails`.
- UI overlays honor current floor count:
  - `drawStateOverlay` clear-state footer only shows "Transitioning..." when floor id is below `FLOORS.length`.
- Run summary pill labels and spacing remain correctly anchored within the summary panel bounds.
- Prompt 6 impact effects implemented:
  - Render-only `fxParticles` array has object pool backed storage and cap by quality tier.
  - Hit events trigger pooled micro sparks near enemy impact points.
  - Death events trigger a ring dissolve and shard-like particles.
  - Update/draw pass runs with line/rect drawing in the world transform and does not mutate gameplay collections.
- Sprite routing behavior:
  - `drawPlayer()` first attempts bucket/legacy resolved directional player art, then falls back to procedural.
  - `buildPlayerSpriteCandidates()` now resolves labeled movement/shoot frames first, then canonical aliases, then legacy root fallback.
  - `drawEnemies()` draws resolved enemy sprites when ready for `enemy.type`, otherwise uses legacy procedural fallbacks.
  - Missing folders or malformed image files never crash render loops; missing assets produce procedural fallback.
  - Idle player facing no longer falls back to stale aim (`lastAimX/lastAimY`) when both movement and shooting inputs are inactive; facing persists for stable idle visuals and avoids intermittent direction jitter while standing still.
  - Homing missiles (`dual`) use a reinforced procedural visual fallback with darker, jittered trail geometry and pulse-coupled detail, so they remain visibly distinct and more threatening when sprites are missing.
  - Homing missile fallback was strengthened further with a staggered broken-fin silhouette, ember drift, and cracked line accents in `drawHomingMissileEnemyProcedural` to increase perceived threat without affecting movement/impact semantics.
  - `AIPU.render.getSpriteLoadState()` exposes sprite-load counters and missing-path diagnostics.
  - Sprite cache state invalidates when resolved candidate path sets change so stale path order/content can never pin a previous image after art rename or input-mode swap.
  - Malformed sprite candidates now advance through the same fallback chain as network/path load failures instead of terminating at the first invalid decode candidate.
  - Player sprite width clamp uses normalized safe radius (`playerRadius`) consistently for both min and max bounds.
- Deterministic automation compatibility:
  - `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` emits concise JSON with coordinate-system note, mode/floor/player state, collection samples, and debug stats.
  - `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` now also exposes `debug.audio` (when `AIPU.audio` is present) so floor music state can be validated from automation snapshots.
  - `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` now also exposes `debug.playerSprite` mode/hold/facing internals for deterministic sprite routing and transition debugging.
  - `AIPU.render.renderGameToText()` now exposes `debug.visualState` with floor pack/theme and water wrapper compound/alpha metrics for floor 1–8 intensity validation.
- Sprite cache busting for character art is now `v=20260222-4`; script tags should remain aligned in `index.html` to guarantee art updates are loaded by clients.
- Script cache-bust alignment and player-cache keys are now expected at `v=20260222-6` for this stability patch.
- Player movement/shoot rendering remains driven by active `Arrow*` input during `player.attackDisableTimer > 0`, preventing stale visual mode locks after lockout.
